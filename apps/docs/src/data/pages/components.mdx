  Components are the reusable building blocks of our design system, designed to
  be flexible enough to meet a wide range of interface challenges. These
  elements, such as buttons, checkboxes, and sliders, are the essential
  ingredients that compose our digital landscape.

Within this section, we document each component in detail, describing its purpose, how it behaves in different contexts, and how it should be coded for consistency. By utilizing these components, designers and developers can craft a myriad of user interfaces that feel familiar to our users, while efficiently scaling our design efforts.
